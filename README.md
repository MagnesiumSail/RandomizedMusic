# Overview

This program played randomized notes using a diatonic scale to make "music"

I made this to learn Java syntax, as well as make my first program that interacts with music.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

- Stop notes from cutting off harshly
- Mess with randomization odds for better sounding music
